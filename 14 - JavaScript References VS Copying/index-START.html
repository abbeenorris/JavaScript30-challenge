    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const team = players;

    console.log(team, players);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

      // team[3] = 'Lux'; Overwirtes the original/ refrences back 

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team2 = players.slice();

    team2[3] = 'Lux';

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'lol';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'hehe';
    console.log(team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

      // const captain = person;
      // captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // const cap3 = {...players}; 

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const abbie = {
      name: 'Abbie',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        facebook: '@abbie',
        twitter: 'Abbie.dev'
      }
    };

    console.log(abbie);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, abbie);
    dev.name = 'Lol';
    dev.social.twitter = 'test'; //Overwrites all because doesn't do 2nd level

    //if want to do a clone (2nd level deep) go on google called clonedeep
  
    //or do this way (cheat way) turns into string and then to object so doesn't affect original

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(abbie));
    dev2.social.facebook = 'another test';
